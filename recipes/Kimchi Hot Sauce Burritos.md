## Ingredients

- 2 unit Scallions
- 6.7 ounce Black Beans
- 1/2 cup Basmati Rice
- 5 teaspoon White Wine Vinegar
- 1 unit Cucumber
- 4 ounce Kimchi Hot Sauce
- 4 tablespoon Sour Cream
- 1 unit Lime
- 4 ounce Shredded Carrots
- 2 unit Flour Tortilla
- 1 tablespoon Butter
- 3/4 cup Water
- 1 teaspoon Sugar

# Method

 1. Wash and dry all produce. Trim, then thinly slice scallions, keeping greens and whites separate. Drain and rinse half the beans (use the rest as you like).
 2. Melt 1 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add scallion whites and rice. Stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add Â¾ cup water, 1 TBSP vinegar (we sent more), and a large pinch of salt to pot. Cover and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Keep covered off heat.
 3. Halve cucumber lengthwise, then slice into thin half-moons. Toss in a medium bowl with 1 TBSP kimchi hot sauce (we sent more), remaining vinegar, a large pinch of salt, and 1 tsp sugar until combined. Set aside. In a small bowl, stir sour cream and 1 TBSP kimchi hot sauce (use less to taste). Season with salt.
 4. Zest lime until you have 1 tsp zest, then cut into quarters. Heat 1 TBSP oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add carrots and cook, tossing, until just tender, 2-3 minutes. Stir in half the lime zest and a squeeze of lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from pan and set aside. Lower heat under pan to medium. Add remaining kimchi hot sauce and drained beans. Cook, stirring, until warmed, about 3 minutes.
 5. Meanwhile, toss together half the cucumber, half the carrots, scallion greens, and a squeeze of lime juice in another medium bowl. Season with salt and pepper. Add remaining lime zest to rice in pot and fluff grains with a fork. Season with salt and pepper. Wrap tortillas in damp paper towels. Microwave on high until warm, 30 to 45 seconds.
 6. Divide half the rice between tortillas (serve the rest on the side or save for another use). Top with beans and remaining cucumbers and carrots. Roll into burritos, then cut each in half. Serve with crema, tossed veggies, and lime wedges on the side.
 7. Enjoy!!!!!
