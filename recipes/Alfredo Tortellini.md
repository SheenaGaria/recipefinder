## Ingredients
- 4 ounce Button Mushrooms
- 2 unit Scallions
- 3 ounce Carrot
- 1 thumb Ginger
- 3/4 cup Jasmine Rice
- 5 teaspoon White Wine Vinegar
- 1 teaspoon Seasame oil
- 1 teaspoon Sriracha
- 2 tablesppon Soy Sauce 
- 2 unit Eggs
- 1 tablespoon Butter
- 1¼ cups Water (2¼ cups for 4 servings)
-  1 tablespoon Sugar (2 tablespoons for 4 servings)

## Method:
1. Wash and dry all produce.
2. Trim and thinly slice mushrooms, scallions(separating whites from greens).Using a peeler, shave carrot lengthwise into ribbons, rotating as you go, until you get to the core; discard core. Peel and mince or grate ginger.
3. Melt 1 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add ginger and cook, stirring, until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in rice, 1¼ cups water (2¼ cups for 4 servings), and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce to a low simmer. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes.
4. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, combine scallion whites, vinegar, and a pinch of salt; set aside to marinate. In a separate small bowl, combine sesame oil, soy sauce, 1 TBSP sugar (2 TBSP for 4 servings), and up to 1 tsp sriracha.
5. Heat a drizzle of oil in a large, preferably nonstick, pan over medium-high heat. Add carrot and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring, until just tender, 3-4 minutes. Transfer to a medium bowl. Transfer to bowl with carrot. Add mushrooms and another drizzle of oil to pan. Cook, stirring, until tender, 3-5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Turn off heat; transfer to bowl with other veggies. Wipe out pan.
6. Heat a drizzle of oil in pan used for veggies over medium heat. Once hot, crack eggs into pan and cover. (For 4 servings, you may want to cook eggs in batches.) Fry eggs to preference. Season with salt and pepper.
7. Fluff rice with a fork and season with salt and pepper; divide between bowls. Arrange carrot and mushrooms on top. Top each bowl with a fried egg and pickled scallion whites (draining first). Drizzle with sauce and any remaining sriracha to taste. Sprinkle with scallion greens and serve.
